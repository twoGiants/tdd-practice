# Stack

## FILO

Implement a stack of integers. It should support:

- pushing integers to it,
- popping integers from it in the FILO style,
- checking the size,
- checking if its empty,
- dealing with an underflow,
- dealing with an overflow.

## FIFO

Same as above but with a firs-in-first-out queue. Use a fixed size array. Use two pointers to track where the elements are to be added and removed.
