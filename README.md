# TDD Practice

## Rules

Taken from *Clean Craftsmanship by Robert C. Martin*.

**`Rule 1:`** *Write the test that forces you to write the code you already know you want to write. (p. 37)*

**`Rule 2:`** *Make it fail. Make it pass. Clean it up. (p. 40)*

**`Rule 3:`** *Don't go for gold. (p. 50)*
